This cfg is for a soldier so you should not use another class. The anti aim does not work with another class. Use it only with the soldier and use an explosion range weapon. By this I mean that you use the original one or the rocket launcher (important). No. If you expose yourself to the bots' aimbot, try to move so they don't kill you.
